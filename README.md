Analysis code for studies on Hbb vs gluon bb studies.

# Environment Setup
The following instructions assume running inside VSCode.
 
```
module load python/3.8-anaconda-2020.11
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The code itself does not depend on VSCode and can be run as standalone Python.
However the environment setup in that case is left as an exercise to the user.
